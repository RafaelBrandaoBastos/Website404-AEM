# Website / Adobe Experience Manager + ReactJS

I, as an user, want a custom page for error 404 - Page not found.

## Instructions

The main parts of the template are:

* 1 Styling: Follow the web/mobile layout as designed by the UX/UI team in a responsive way.
* 2 Componentizing: It will be free according to the need of the developer.
* 3 Git: The code must be versioned using Git and kept in a freely chosen repository (Github is recommended). The creation of branches and commits will be free according to the need of the developer.
